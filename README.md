# Book Worm
Word game similar to Book Worm by Pop Cap which I played as a kid


I used the Oxford Dictionary API to create this game and I used a wrapper for ruby to get it to cooperate.
Everything else was coded by me, all the text within this repo is my own.

# Disclaimer
I do not presume to have created Book Worm or anything like that. I wanted to make this for a project because I played the game all through my childhood and though it would be a good benchmark for my skills at this point in my first year of college at Neumont College of Computer Science. This project can be seen as open source and anybody who would like to use it can, but if you do please message me I'd love to know. lucasmcmanus21@gmail.com for any inquiries
